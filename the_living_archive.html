   This collaborative, community-engaged part of the project seeks to incorporate the voices and faces of Black Oakland’s residents, both past and present. Here, we realize the creative and life-affirming possibilities of transforming the city in service of its Black residents. To do so, we have produced collaborative photographs and film projects about Oakland’s Black placemaking histories. This work highlights the specificity of Black women’s experiences of homelessness, while articulating these stories to foundational Black women’s organizing and housing struggles in Oakland.
